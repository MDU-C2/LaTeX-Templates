# LaTeX Templates for Bachelor's and Master's

This repository provides a suite of LaTeX templates designed with Bachelor's and Master's students in mind. While they are made to cater to the needs of a broad range of students, the templates are particularly tailored for Robotics Engineering students. 

## Purpose
These templates serve various purposes, such as presentations, self-evaluations, project planning, and thesis writing. While some templates have a specific design focus, they are adaptable and versatile, making them applicable to various academic requirements.

One notable template is the Thesis template, a versatile tool that can be used by students writing a Master's thesis, Licentiate, or Doctoral thesis. These templates are designed to provide a well-structured, professional, and consistent format for academic documents.

## Structure 
The templates included in this repository are as follows:

- `Presentation`
- `Project-Charter`
- `Project-Plan`
- `Proposal`
- `Self-Evaluation`
- `Technical-Report`
- `Thesis`

The `Self-Evaluation` template follows an older examination structure, while the `Project-Plan` and `Project-Charter` are designed based on the templates from Författare: Bo Tonnquist. The `Proposal` template is primarily designed for Master's students but can also be used by Ph.D. students. The `Technical-Report` template is an adaptation of the default IEEE tran Conference template, but with additional structure. It can be used for preparing publications.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository and begin using the templates straight away. Each folder contains a LaTeX template about its title. 
Either clone the repository or press "Code" and Download Zip.

## Usage

The templates are prepared as LaTeX files. To use them, open the desired template with any LaTeX editor and replace the placeholder text with your content. 

If you prefer an online LaTeX editor, you can upload the templates to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Here are the steps to do this:

Please maintain the document's structure while editing and keep the formatting consistent, maintaining a professional appearance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your machine. We recommend using [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Unix/Linux systems, [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for MacOS, and [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows.

If you're using Overleaf, no local LaTeX installation is needed as the platform is entirely web-based.
