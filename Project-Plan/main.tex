\section{Executive summary}
\helper{A short summary of the project plan}

\section{Background}
\helper{Description with a clear and defined connection to the goals. It is advisable
to connect to any related project in the background description.}

\section{Purpose}
\helper{The impact the project is expected to create, i.e. why it is important to execute the project.  }
\section{Goal}
\helper{The result the project should deliver, i.e. what should be achieved when the project is executed.  }
\section{Scope}
\helper{What is included as part of the project and must be performed in order to deliver the goal. The scope is described with a
WBS at the overarching level – main packages with a brief description of each. The complete WBS should be included as
an attachment.}
\section{Limitations}
\helper{What the project should not deliver. The purpose is to avoid false expectations among the different stakeholders.}

\section{Requirement}
\subsection{Product requirements}
\helper{The product specification describes the product that is to be delivered. It is a description of the product in terms of its functionality, performance, quality, etc.}
\subsubsection{Functional requirements}
\helper{The functional requirements describe the functions that the product must do.}
\subsubsection{Non-functional requirements}
\helper{The non-functional requirements describe the technical specifications of the product in details: e.g. colors, performance, quality metrics.}

\subsection{Project requirements}
\helper{Requirements on the execution and prioritization between the project’s triple constraints.}
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\helper{Demands on the project’s sponsor/owner or client that have to be achieved to ensure the project’s execution and result.}

\section{Handover \& Implementation}
\helper{How to deliver the product to the client and implement it into the environment it is meant for.}

\section{Situational analysis and stakeholders}
\subsection{SWOT-analysis}
\helper{Mapping and analysis of external and internal factors that might affect execution.}
