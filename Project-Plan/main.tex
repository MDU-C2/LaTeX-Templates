\section{Executive summary}
\helper{A short summary of the project plan}

\section{Mission}
\subsection{Background}
\helper{Description with a clear and defined connection to the goal and the business value, (see Project Charter).  It is advisable
to connect to any related project in the background description.}
\subsection{Purpose}
\helper{The impact the project is expected to create, i.e. why it is important to execute the project, (see Project Charter).  }
\subsection{Goal}
\helper{The result the project should deliver, i.e. what should be achieved when the project is executed, (see Project Charter).  }
\subsection{Scope}
\helper{What is included as part of the project and must be performed in order to deliver the goal. The scope is described with a
WBS at the overarching level – main packages with a brief description of each. The complete WBS should be included as
an attachment.}
\subsection{Limitations}
\helper{What the project should not deliver. The purpose is to avoid false expectations among the different stakeholders.}

\section{Requirement specification}
\subsection{Product specification}
\helper{Requirements on the project’s result/product}
\subsection{Project specification}
\helper{Requirements on the execution and prioritization between the project’s triple constraints.}
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\helper{Demands on the project’s sponsor/owner or client that have to be achieved to ensure the project’s execution and result.}

\section{Handover \& Implementation}
\helper{How to deliver the product to the client and implement it into the environment it is meant for.}
